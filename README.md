### 🐾 Cat-Dog Detector
A Python-based deep learning application that classifies images as either a cat or a dog. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project provides an interactive interface for users to upload images and receive real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features
🧠 Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a CNN architecture trained on a dataset of cat and dog images.

📂 Image Upload: Users can upload images for classification.

⚡ Real-time Prediction: Instantly predicts whether the uploaded image is of a cat or a dog.

🖥️ User Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend: Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)

Backend: Python, TensorFlow/Keras

Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
